This Codecademy project focuses on writing several functions that organise and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. 9 functions are created which execute the following:

1. Returns a new list of updated damages where the recorded data is converted to float values and the missing data is retained as "Damages not recorded".
2. Constructs a dictionary made out of the lists, where the keys of the dictionary are the names of the hurricanes, and the values are dictionaries themselves containing a key for each piece of data (Name, Month, Year,Max Sustained Wind, Areas Affected, Damage, Death) about the hurricane.
3. Converts the current dictionary of hurricanes to a new dictionary, where the keys are years and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that occurred in that year.
4. Counts how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane. 
5. Finds the area affected by the most hurricanes, and how often it was hit.
6. Finds the hurricane that caused the greatest number of deaths, and how many deaths it caused.
7. Rates hurricanes according to the provided mortality scale, where the keys are mortality ratings and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that falls into that mortality rating.
8. Finds the hurricane that caused the greatest damage, and how costly it was.
9. Rates hurricanes according to the provided damage scale, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper bound of damage for that rating.
